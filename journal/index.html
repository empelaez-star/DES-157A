        <p>I read the article “Best practices for form design” on UX Collective, and it made me realize how much thought actually goes into something as simple as filling out a form. The author breaks down a bunch of small but important details like keeping forms short, sticking to a single column layout, and giving users clear feedback when they make a mistake. One part that stood out to me was how the order of questions can affect a user’s flow. Starting with easy questions helps people feel more comfortable and keeps them moving forward. I also liked the reminder not to rely only on color for error messages, something that’s easy to overlook but super important for accessibility.</p>

        <p>A website that I think shows these best practices really well is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/"> Spotify</a>
        . Their sign-up form feels modern and clean, colorful, and super easy to move through. The layout is simple, and the real-time feedback makes the whole process feel quick. It matches their brand’s energetic vibe while still being really user friendly.</p>
