         <p>I found the NYT article real interesting, I never realized how much you can “read” a photo like a story. The questions they suggest really make you slow down and notice details you’d normally miss. It’s such a fun and different way to practice critical thinking without feeling like you’re doing typical schoolwork. The website I chose to practice these techiques with was <a href="https://www.bob-snail.com/gb/">Bob Snail.</a>It is extremly coloful and eye catching, so I was drawn to it fast. This website is letting the viewer observe, with the product imaages that are plain to see, and askes questions; "what is this?". Overall a visually appealing website that had me curious about what it was selling. </p>

        <p>I really liked this article on best practices for modals and overlays, it made me think differently about how these little pop-ups affect the user experience. The main takeaway was that modals should only show up when they really need to, like when something needs your full attention. I also appreciated the reminder that users should always have an easy way out, whether it’s an “X” button, hitting Escape, or just clicking outside the box. The point about not stacking multiple modals made me laugh a little, it’s so true, that just gets messy fast. I also liked how it covered accessibility and mobile design; it’s easy to forget that not everyone experiences modals the same way. Overall, super helpful read!

        <h2>Entry 1</h2>
         <time datetime="2025-10-09">October 09, 2025</time>
        <p>I read the article “Best practices for form design” on UX Collective, and it made me realize how much thought actually goes into something as simple as filling out a form. The author breaks down a bunch of small but important details like keeping forms short, sticking to a single column layout, and giving users clear feedback when they make a mistake. One part that stood out to me was how the order of questions can affect a user’s flow. Starting with easy questions helps people feel more comfortable and keeps them moving forward. I also liked the reminder not to rely only on color for error messages, something that’s easy to overlook but super important for accessibility.</p>
        <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Original Article</a>
        <p>A website that I think shows these best practices really well is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/"> Spotify</a>
        . Their sign-up form feels modern and clean, colorful, and super easy to move through. The layout is simple, and the real-time feedback makes the whole process feel quick. It matches their brand’s energetic vibe while still being really user friendly.</p>
