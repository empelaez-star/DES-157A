            My changes that I am working on are the interaction elements of my project. I have a layout that I like now it's just the javascript that needs the most work. I want to scale up my images when clicked on and for them to move a little when they are being hovered over as well, to let the viewer know that the objects are interactive and can be clicked on. After that it is having a text bubble pop up along side the object when clicked on, to show a message on the significance of that object to me. I have also picked out the font I plan on using for this project, to give it more personality!
            <br>
            Here is my idea for what I want to do coding wise, I am using an example from a previous practice we did before in class as a foundation:<br>
            const item = document.querySelectorAll("img");<br>

            item.addEventListener('mouseover', function(){<br>
            item.innerHTML = "The mouse is over the box!";<br>
             });<br>

          item.addEventListener('mouseout', function(){<br>
            item.innerHTML = "The mouse has left the box!";<br>
                });<br>
                })()<br>

                I am hoping to use mouseover to get my images to move, I tried to use hover in css but that didn't work!
